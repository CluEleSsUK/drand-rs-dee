dee is a tool to retrieve public randomness generated by drand beacon. It features an HTTP client, and verification method.

The format specification is at [drand.love/docs/specification](https://drand.love/docs/specification/). drand was designed in [Scalable Bias-Resistant Distributed Randomness](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1067.pdf).

The reference interroperable Go implementation is available at [drand/drand](https://github.com/drand/drand).

## Usage

```bash
dee chain add mainnet https://api.drand.sh # Add a new beacon
dee get --set-upstream mainnet 1000 # Fetch round 1000 and set upstream to mainnet
dee get --format json # Fetch latest mainnet round as json

dee chain add testnet https://testnet0-api.drand.cloudflare.com/f3827d772c155f95a9fda8901ddd59591a082df5ac6efe3a479ddb1f5eeb202c # Add a new beacon
dee chain info testnet # Retrieve information about testnet beacon
```
